## TD-001: Shared S3 bucket with nemo-tfm deployment

**Date:** 2026-05-17
**Severity:** Low (demo environment)
**Status:** Accepted for demo, must resolve before production

### Description
The pragma-encoder DSPA shares an S3 bucket with the
nemo-tfm deployment (transaction-foundation-model-openshiftai).
Pipeline artifacts from both deployments are stored in the
same bucket, differentiated only by KFP-generated run ID prefixes.

### Risk
- No hard isolation between the two deployments
- A bucket policy change affecting one affects both
- Cost attribution is unclear across deployments
- In production, data governance requires separate buckets
  per workload with separate IAM policies

### Resolution
Create a dedicated S3 bucket for pragma-encoder:
  Bucket: pragma-encoder-pipelines-<unique-suffix>
  IAM policy: scoped to pragma-encoder namespace only
  Region: same as nemo-tfm bucket

Re-seal the workbench runtime secret with new bucket values:
  kubeseal --scope namespace-wide \
    --namespace pragma-encoder \
    --format yaml \
    < openshift/secrets/workbench-secret.yaml \
    > openshift/gitops/secrets/workbench-runtime-secret.sealed.yaml

## TD-002: NGC API key shared across deployments

**Date:** 2026-05-17
**Severity:** Low (demo environment)
**Status:** Accepted for demo, must resolve before production

### Description
The NGC API key used for pulling nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:25.09.01
is the same key used in the nemo-tfm deployment.

### Risk
- Key rotation in one deployment requires updating both
- Rate limits on NGC API key are shared
- No audit trail separation between deployments

### Resolution
Generate a dedicated NGC API key for pragma-encoder:
  Log in to ngc.nvidia.com
  Generate a new API key scoped to pragma-encoder usage
  Re-seal registry-pull-secret.sealed.yaml with new key
  Rotate the nemo-tfm key independently
